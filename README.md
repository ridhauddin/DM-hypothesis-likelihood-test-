# DM-hypothesis-likelihood-test-

This [code](likelihood test statistic.py) calculates the likelihood and test statistic between the DM hypothesis and the Null hypothesis

DM hypothesis is the total emission of the cluster consisting of the cosmic ray and DM emission. In contrast, the Null hypothesis is total emission of the cluster consists of the cosmic ray emission only.
